search your first term:

`bash ahmia.sh Логи`

search your second term:

`bash ahmia.sh США`

find the intersection of the two sets:

`bash intersect.sh`

print the result to screen:

`bash логи+сша.txt`

clean up your .txt files once you're done recording info before your next run as not to confuse intersect.sh

`rm *.txt`

also note, you can do as many terms for intersection as you like (within resource limitations)
